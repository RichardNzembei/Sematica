# 🎨 Talkey 2.0 – UI Design Workflow

This document outlines the step-by-step workflow for designing the Talkey 2.0 platform using Figma. It is focused on clarity, simplicity, and a smooth experience for non-technical users.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Figma Project Setup

- Create a new Figma file
- Rename it: `Talkey 2.0 - UI Design`
- Create Pages:
  - `01 - Wireframes`
  - `02 - Components`
  - `03 - Final Screens`
  - `04 - Prototypes`

---

## ✏️ STEP 2: Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Design the structure using grayscale layouts (boxes and text):

- Login / Register
- Business Onboarding (3 steps)
- Main Dashboard
- Assistant Builder
- Channel Setup
- Product & Payment Setup
- Analytics Page

> Focus on layout and navigation before styling.

---

## 🧱 STEP 3: UI Kit (Design System)

Create and organize reusable components:

- Buttons (Primary, Secondary)
- Inputs (with labels)
- Status Chips, Toggles, Tabs
- Modals, Cards
- Sidebar Navigation

### Design Tokens
- Font: **Inter**
- Primary Color: `#0057FF`
- Accent Green: `#00C28C`
- Background Gray: `#F7F9FC`
- Text Color: `#1A1A1A`

---

## 🖼️ STEP 4: High-Fidelity UI Screens

Convert wireframes into fully designed screens:

- Login / Register
- Onboarding Flow
- Dashboard (with stats and quick actions)
- Assistant Builder (visual logic flow)
- Channels Setup
- Product Setup
- Analytics & Feedback
- Conversation Logs

Use your UI Kit for consistency. Apply spacing and grid rules.

---

## 🔁 STEP 5: Interactive Prototyping

- Use Figma's `Prototype` feature
- Link buttons to target screens
- Animate transitions (onboarding → dashboard → builder)
- Add overlays for modals and dropdowns

---

## 💾 STEP 6: Organize & Share

- Name your frames and components properly
- Group screens into feature sets
- Export assets (SVG, PNG)
- Share Figma link: `https://figma.com/file/YOUR-LINK`

---

## 📁 File Layout in Figma

```
Talkey 2.0 - UI Design
├── 01 - Wireframes
├── 02 - Components (UI Kit)
├── 03 - Final Screens
├── 04 - Prototypes
```

---

## 📌 Tips for Efficiency

- Use real sample content, not placeholder text
- Keep it mobile-friendly (responsive layouts)
- Include error/empty/loading states
- Use Auto Layout + Components to speed up dev handoff
